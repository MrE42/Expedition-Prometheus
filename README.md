# Expedition-Prometheus
Expedition-Prometheus is a VR space shooter developed with Unity. Stepping into the shoes of Doctor Armstrong, players are tasked with safeguarding the cabin of their ship from the onslaught of infected crewmembers, all while protecting precious cargo destined for Earth. Wielding a powerful arm cannon, players become the last line of defense against their once trusted crew. The ship's batteries are key to survival and are used for powering the arm cannon and sealing off the cabin doors. Savvy management of these resources is imperative, adding a layer of strategy to the action. Navigating the ship's central control panel, players must tactically charge batteries, use their arm cannon charge shot, and selectively seal doors to hold back the infected crew. The game's style pays tribute to the aesthetic of the PS2 era. The charm of pixelated textures, minimalist yet unsettling scene lighting, and distorted audio shapes the atmosphere throughout the game into something we hope all PS2 gamers can enjoy.
